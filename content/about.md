I am GunGyeom "James" Kim (<span lang="ko">김건겸</span>). I finished my Master of Computer Science (mscs) at [NorthEastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) recently.
Before this, I studied Mathematics Education in my undergraduate at [SangMyung University](https://www.smu.ac.kr/). 
[\[CV\]](../cv.pdf)

Outside of my profession, I love playing soccer, reading manga and webtoon, and any indoor/outdoor activity. I value helping community and volunteering, so I try to participate regularly.
